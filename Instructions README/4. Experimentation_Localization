This instruction was created to run the steps use for our experimentation

NOTE: Refer to the main Readme.md file for description of each package.

# Package: Localization

1. Iinitialize catkin workspace

$ cd ~/chairbot_ws/src && catkin_init_workspace

2. Within `src`, clone the `teleop` package

$ cd ~/chairbot_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git

3. Move back to the project directory and build

$ cd ..
$ catkin_make

4. Launch the world and robot

$ source ~/chairbot_ws/devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch chairbot_localization single_chair.launch

5. SLAM (this step is optional, only if would like to create a new map, otherwise you can skip to step number 7.)

$ roslaunch chairbot_localization chairbot_localization_slam.launch

NOTE: you will need to adjust the view further to the left side in the rviz window to see the map.

6. Open another terminal, and run the `teleop` node and move around, then save the map.

roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/chairbot_ws/src/chairbot_localization/maps/office_map4

7. Close all terminal, to test localization use run the following command.

NOTE: if you are using the old map set in chairbot_localization.launch and not the map you generated update ensure to update the path in office_map.pgm

terminal_1

$ roslaunch chairbot_localization single_chair.launch

terminal_2

$ roslaunch chairbot_localization chairbot_localization.launch

terminal_3

roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

NOTE: notice the logs for the localization, when the chairbot is out of the map you will get a notification.
