This instruction was created to run the steps use for our experimentation

NOTE: Refer to the main Readme.md file for description of each package.

# Package: Navigation

## Build
    1. Initialize a catkin workspace

    $ cd ~/chairbot_ws/src && catkin_init_workspace

    2. Move back to the project folder and build

    $ cd ..
    $ catkin_make

    3. In a terminal Launch the world and robot

    $ source ~/chairbot_ws/devel/setup.bash
    $ roslaunch chairbot_navigation single_chair.launch


## SLAM Mapping
    NOTE: this section is optional, only if would like to create a new map, otherwise you can skip and proceed to navigation section

    1. In a second terminal launch the `chairbot_navigation_slam.launch` file to start the creating SLAM mapping.

    $ roslaunch chairbot_navigation chairbot_navigation_slam.launch


    2. Open third terminal, and run the `teleop` node and move around, then save the map.

    $ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch


    3. Open fourth terminal, save the map on the intended localtion

    $ rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/chairbot_ws/src/chairbot_navigation/maps/office_map4

    4. Stop and close all terminal, then Move to the navigation part

## Navigation

    NOTE: if you are using the old map set in chairbot_navigation.launch and not the map you generated update ensure to update the path in office_map2.pgm

    1. In a terminal Launch the world and robot

    $ source ~/chairbot_ws/devel/setup.bash
    $ roslaunch chairbot_navigation single_chair.launch

    2. Open second terminal Launch `chairbot_navigation.launch`

    $ source ~/chairbot_ws/devel/setup.bash
    $ roslaunch chairbot_navigation chairbot_navigation.launch map_file:=$HOME/chairbot_ws/src/chairbot_navigation/maps/office_map2.yaml

    3. Go to rviz and test the navigation by clicking "2D Post Estinamate" and "2D Nav Goal".
