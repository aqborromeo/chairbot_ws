# Package: Multi-robot Mapping

## Build
    1. Initialize a catkin workspace

    $ cd ~/chairbot_ws/src && catkin_init_workspace

    2. Move back to the project folder and build

    $ cd ..
    $ catkin_make

    3. In a terminal Launch the world and robot

    $ source devel/setup.bash

    4. You may set the Turtlebot type in setup.bash if the system is not detecting the correct type.

    $ echo 'export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi' >> devel/setup.bash

    5. Launch the world and Rviz map.

    $ roslaunch ros_multi_tb3 custom_multi_tb3_office2.launch

    6. Launch each robot's exploration module, individually with:

    $ roslaunch explore_lite explore_0.launch

    $ roslaunch explore_lite explore_1.launch
 
    $ roslaunch explore_lite explore_2.launch

    7. Or launch them all at once with:

    $ roslaunch explore_lite explore_all.launch

    8. Save map once mapping is finished.

    $ rosrun map_server map_saver -f src/chairbot_navigation/maps/office_tables_2_map2
